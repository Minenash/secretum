# Project Secretum

[Tadhg Boyle](https://github.com/Aberdeener) and I are starting a privacy focused web, mobile, and eventually desktop, chat service, called Secretum. This is just a cool project to work on, and to learn more about webdeving and programming with privacy, not just in consideration, but as a primary focus. We are not planning to be a competitor to any major players. My role will primarily be the database and the mobile apps.

What I hope to learn thought out the course of the project:

- Interactively using PHP
- Javascript, but keeping it to a minimum
- How to connect to a database using Flutter/Dart
- How to check the database even when the app is closed.
- How to keep the minimum amount of information about a user as possible
- Reenforce my skills in SQL and Database Design
- Continue to expand my capabilities in Flutter/Dart
